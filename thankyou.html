    <h1>Thank You, Shieen</h1>
    <p>Happy birthday again!</p>
    <p>I just want to tell you that thank you, not just for being a good friend, but for being you.</p>

      Thank you for always being understanding. You make me feel heard, whether I’m at my lowest or just rambling about random stuff. You have no idea how much that means to me.

      Thanks for being patient with me, kahit di tayo nagkakaintindihan minsan kase iba-iba na pinagsasabi ko😅 at especially when I mess up my words or get mixed up. I know my Tagalog isn’t the best even though I’m Filipino, but you never make me feel awkward or out of place.

      I also really appreciate your honesty, and just the way you are. Please don’t ever change. Keep being the kind, genuine, and real person you’ve always been, kahit kupal ka🫶

      Enjoy your special day!! You deserve it all! ! ! (◍•ᴗ•◍)
